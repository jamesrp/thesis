We study the application of sum of squares methods to combinatorial optimization
problems. By relaxing a nonnegativity condition to a sum of squares condition,
we get polynomial-time approximations to NP-hard problems. Analyzing the
gap between nonnegativity and sums of squares in different settings lets us
understand the quality of these approximations. In this thesis we use 
techniques from real algebraic geometry, representation theory, and convex
algebraic geometry to solve these problems. We obtain results for the 
max cut problem and the $K_i$ cover problem. We also prove some results of
interest to real algebraic geometry and representation theory.
