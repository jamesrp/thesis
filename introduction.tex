\section{The Theta Body of the Stable Set Problem}
This thesis studies the application of sums of squares to combinatorial
optimization. Chapters 2-X each cover a different aspect of this research.
In this introduction, we give a case study in which we apply sums of squares
to the stable set problem, and introduce many of the concepts which will be 
used in the following chapters. Then we give an extended abstract of each
chapter.

\subsection{Combinatorial Optimization Problems}
Combinatorial optimization is the branch of optimization problems concerning
finding the best object from a discrete set. Applications are common in 
computer science, mathematics, and operations research. For instance, the 
objective of traveling salesman problem is to find a minimum-cost tour among
a set of cities; the shortest path problem is to find a shortest-distance
path between two nodes in a graph; and the assignment problem is to assign
workers to jobs while minimizing the total wages paid. In particular, we will
consider the 
stable set problem, where we find the maximum-size independent vertex set in a
graph.

Combinatorial optimization problems often end up being NP-complete or harder.
That is, we are unlikely to ever find efficient algorithms to solve them
exactly. And in some cases where the abstract mathematical problem does have
an efficient algorithm, real-world constraints can make it intractable. For
instance, when assigning medical students to residencies, the constraint that
married couples live in the same city makes the problem NP-complete.

Therefore, much research has focused on developing methods to solve these
problems approximately. In this paper, we describe one such method based on
sums of squares.

\subsection{Sums of Squares and Optimization}
Consider for the moment unconstrained optimization problems on $\RR^n$. That 
is, we are given a function $f$ in $n$ real variables, and must find the 
global minimum value $f_{\min}$. We can rephrase this as $f_{\min} = 
\max \{r: f(x) - r \ge 0\}$. Now if we can write $f(x) - r$ as a sum of squares,
then it is certainly nonnegative. Therefore, we can define the relaxation
$f_{\textup{sos}} = \max \{r: f(x) - r \textup{ is a sum of squares}\}$.
We have that $f_{\min} \ge f_{\textup{sos}}$, so this is a lower bound on
the minimum. This idea is discussed at more length in \cite{sostools} and 
\cite{lasserre}. We now specialize to the case of combinatorial optimization.

\subsection{The Theta Body}
We would like to apply the $f_{\textup{sos}}$ construction above to
combinatorial optimization problems. We will explain how to do this through
an example.

The {\em stable set problem} is, given a graph $G = (V,E)$, to find the
maximum size of a vertex set which is completely disconnected. We can embed
this problem in $\RR^n$ as follows. Let $n = |V|$ and label the vertices by 
$1, \ldots, n$. For each stable set $S \subseteq V$, let $\chi_S$ be its 
characteristic vector: $(\chi_S)_i = 1$ if $i \in S$, and 0 if $i \notin S$.
The collection $X$ of these characteristic vectors forms a discrete point set
in $\RR^n$, and in fact it is an algebraic variety. Its ideal
$I$ is generated by $\{x_i^2 - x_i \, (1\le i \le n);\, x_ix_j\, (ij \in E) \}$.

The problem of finding the maximum size of a stable set can now be rephrased
over $\RR^n$ as finding the minimum value of the function
$f(x) = - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ over the set $X$ given above. To use the
$f_{\textup{sos}}$ idea, we need to define a notion of being a sum of squares
on $X$. As long as $X$ is an algebraic set, this is accomplished in 
\cite{glpt}. The method is to take a basis $B$ for $\RR[x]/I$ and use 
semidefinite programming to calculate the space of sums of squares mod $I$ by
computing in the basis $B$. One caveat is that we need to restrict the 
squares to some bounded degree $k$ to get a polynomial-time algorithm. If
we set $k=1$ we get the celebrated Lovasz theta body for the stable set
problem, which was the inspiration for \cite{glpt}. By increasing $k$ we
increase the runtime of our algorithm but potentially improve its accuracy;
this is discussed in chapter X. 

\subsection{Structure of the Thesis}
In the remainder of the introduction, we give an extended abstract of each
chapter. We will describe the problem and its motivation and applications,
and give a precise statement of results and an indication of how they were 
proved.

Of course, the papers themselves are present as the other chapters here, so
they are available to also read. However, the goal of this introduction
is to give a precise overview of results and be a guide to the rest of the
thesis.

\section{A Semidefinite Approach to the $K_\MakeLowercase{i}$ Cover Problem}
Chapter 2 is taken from a paper coauthored with Jo\~ao Gouveia and submitted to 
\emph{Operations Research Letters}. 

The {\em $K_i$-cover problem} is a generalization of the stable set problem discussed
in Chapter 1.1. A graph $G = (V,E)$ is given. For any $k$, a $k$-clique in $G$,
denoted $K_i$,
is a collection of $k$ nodes, each pair of which is connected by an edge in $E$.
We define a covering relation, where an $i$-clique $H_1$ is covered by an 
$(i-1)$-clique $H_2$ if $H_1 \supseteq H_2$; i.e., if $H_2$ is a subgraph of
$H_1$. A $K_i$-cover in $G$ is a
collection $\mathcal{F}$ of $(i-1)$-cliques in $G$ such that each $i$-clique in $G$
is covered by some element of $\mathcal{F}$. The $K_i$-cover problem is to find such a
collection $\mathcal{F}$ of smallest size.
In the graph $G$ in Figure \ref{K5}, a $K_4$-cover is given by $\{012,034,023\}$.

\end{figure}

When $i=2$, this is the \emph{vertex cover problem} - to find the smallest
set $\mathcal{F}$ of vertices such that each edge touches a vertex in
$\mathcal{F}$. To make the
connection to the stable set problem, note that $\mathcal{F} \subseteq V$ is a vertex
cover if and only if $V \setminus \mathcal{F}$ is a stable set.
Therefore, the problems are essentially equivalent. In fact, the polytopes
defined by these problems as in section 1.1 are congruent via the transformation
$x_j \mapsto 1-x_j$ in each coordinate.

The stable set and vertex cover problems have been studied in many contexts. 
The $K_i$-cover generalization was first studied in Conforti et al 
\cite{conforti}, wherein the associated polytope $P_i(G)$ was 
considered and several families of facets identified. 
As in Section 1.1, $P_i(G) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ is the convex hull of
characteristic vectors of $K_i$-covers, where $N$ is the number of $K_{i-1}$s in
$G$. 
Conforti et al provided polynomial-time {\em separation oracles} for many of these families of facets. 
A separation oracle for a family $\mathcal{F}$ of facets is a decision procedure
which takes a point $x$ and decides whether $x$ satisfies each facet $F \in
\mathcal{F}$, or whether $x$ lies outside some facet $F \in \mathcal{F}$.
Since a typical family $\mathcal{F}$ will contain exponentially many elements, it is not possible in general to enumerate the $F \in \mathcal{F}$ and check them one by one, making such an oracle a nontrivial result.

Conforti et al left open the existence of oracles for several families of
facets, including the family associated with the {\em $K_i$-$p$-holes}. 
A graph $H$ is a $K_i$-$p$-hole if it contains $p$ copies of $K_i$ arranged in a cycle, with neighboring $K_i$ sharing a common $K_{i-1}$. 
This does not determine $H$ up to isomorphism; see Figure 2 for three nonisomorpic $K_3$-9-holes.
To see the facet associated to a $K_i$-$p$-hole, consider the graphs in Figure 2. 
To construct a $K_3$-cover of minimum size, we need to pick an edge from each $K_3$. 
We can pick four edges to eliminate eight $K_3$s, but we still need a fifth to pick up the last $K_3$. 
Therefore, $\sum_{e \subseteq H} x_e \ge 5$ is valid on the polytope $P_3(G)$ for any graph $G$ containing $H$ as a subgraph. 
The inequality for general $K_i$-$p$-holes is derived from a similar argument,
and is given by $\sum_{e \subseteq H} x_e \ge \lceil \frac{p}{2} \rceil$.
It defines a facet of $P_i(G)$ for $i \ge 3$ and odd $p$.

\end{figure}

We showed that this family of facets is valid on the theta body $\textup{TH}_{i/2}(G)$. 
Therefore, for fixed $i$, we have a polynomial-time algorithm to optimize over a relaxation at least as tight as this family. 
We don't fully address the open question in Conforti, because this is not a separation oracle for the family $\mathcal{F}$ of $K_i$-$p$-holes. 
Let $Q$ be the body defined as the intersection of all $F \in \mathcal{F}$.
We have $P_i(G) \subseteq \textup{TH}_{i/2}(G) \subseteq Q$.
In terms of an approximation to $P_i(G)$, the theta body is sufficient, since we can optimize over it in polynomial time. 
However, this doesn't allow us to optimize over exactly $Q$ in polynomial time.
In fact, for $i=2$, the stable set case, we have a similar phenomenon.
$\textup{STAB}(G) \subseteq \textup{TH}(G) \subseteq \textup{QSTAB}(G)$, where STAB is the convex hull of stable sets in $G$ and QSTAB is the LP relaxation given by clique inequalities.
In this case both STAB and QSTAB are NP-hard to optimize over, while TH can be optimized over in polynomial time.

To show that the $K_i$-$p$-hole facets were valid on the theta body, we choose a set of 
polynomials which are idempotent mod $I$, and whose sum is the facet-defining
inequality. There are yet more families of facets not addressed by Conforti 
et al, and for these we were not able to find a theta body representation. 
Computer simulations show that they may not be exact on the theta body, but
more work is needed.

We also use the $i=3$ case of the $K_i$-cover problem, known as the triangle
cover problem, to prove two corollaries. 
The first corollary is that $P_3(K_n) \subsetneq \textup{TH}_{k}(K_n)$ for $k < n/2$.
That is, it takes at least $n/2$ steps for the theta body heirarchy to capture the triangle free polytope for $K_n$, and therefore this heirarchy does not give a polynomial-time algorithm for the triangle free problem.
We showed this by applying a result of Laurent that the same $n/2$ theta body is necessary to equal the cut polytope.

The second corollary is that there is an integrality gap of $1/2$ for the triangle cover's theta relaxation. 
That is, if we optimize in the all-1 direction as in the triangle cover problem, we have $\min \{1 \cdot x: x \in \textup{TH}_2(G) \} \ge \frac{1}{2} \min \{1 \cdot x: x \in P_3(G)\}$ for all $G$. 
We prove this by applying a result of Krivelevich on a fractional relaxation of the same problem, and proving that the theta body is contained in this fractional relaxation.

\section{A Note on Notation}
The following chapters were published as separate papers, and in some cases
refer to different aspects of the same or related problems. As such, the 
chapters use different notation to fit the topic at hand, so the same object
may have different names in different chapters.
