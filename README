basic compilation:
python compile.py    # Compiles stub.tex
python compile.py -f # Compiles thesis.tex and does bibtex

issues: I have texlive-full installed on ubuntu 13.04. This is certainly 
overkill but I wanted to make sure I have all packages to reduce headaches.

update: it looks like I can make do with smaller packages. I forgot which they are now though.
