\abstract{
\thispagestyle{empty}
We prove some asymptotic results in bootstrap percolation, a probabilistic model of nucleation and growth.
We then study the application of sum of squares methods to combinatorial optimization problems. 
We analyze the gap between nonnegativity and sums of squares to understand the quality of certain approximations to the max cut problem and $K_i$-cover problem.
We also prove a result on the representation theory of the space of matchings.
