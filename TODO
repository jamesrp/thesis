TODO list for thesis:

Write abstract
 Very short. 1 sentence outline, 2 sentence model/problem domain,
 2 sentence results

Write introduction
 Give an introduction to the general area of study (so probably combinatorial
 optimization, sums of squares, semidefinite programming, more?). 
 Give outline of the rest of the introduction - relevant math, then each paper
 Short overview of the relevant mathematics, open problems, applications.
 For each paper, describe its motivation (what problems it addresses and why
 we care, possibly applications as well). Give reasonably precise statements
 of the results proved, and overviews of the methods used.
 Give a warning about notation differing between chapters.

Import Bootstrap Percolation paper
 -> Make sure images work
 -> Make sure bibliography works

Citations - figure out why \cite{kicover} doesn't work in the chapter title

(in the future, write and import cube paper, mohit paper, and monty paper)
